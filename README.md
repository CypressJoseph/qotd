# qotd

## Synopsis

`qotd` is a tiny frontend application that serves a friendly, daily dashboard, which reminds you of the current day of the week and offers an inspiring quote. It interacts with several APIs (a quote-of-the-day service, the unsplash source API) and is intended to be a tiny reference application for end-to-end testing with Cypress.
